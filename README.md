![Bloom v0.0.1 Icon](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15027214/bloom-icon.png)

Bloom acts as a central repository for reuseable React components and common styles to promote consistency across various projects at Appear Here. It also acts as a style guide to demonstrate how components should be used on their own and in combination with each other.

It's been bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and has a number of additional features to make development easier.

Find the [development roadmap on Trello](https://trello.com/b/GEtat29h/bloom-development).

## Use Bloom in your project

Include Bloom in your projects like any other npm/yarn module:

```shell
npm install @appearhere/bloom
```

or

```shell
yarn install @appearhere/bloom
```

You'll now be able to require components from bloom like any other module:

```javascript
var bloom = require('@appearhere/bloom');
var Link = require('@appearhere/bloom/components/Link/Link');

// ES2016
import bloom from '@appearhere/bloom';
import Link from '@appearhere/bloom/components/Link/Link';
```

If the module import fails like so, `You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type`, you'll need to make sure you're transpiling Bloom along with the rest of your code:

```javascript
// BEFORE
{
  test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
  include: './src',
  loader: 'babel',
  query: require('./babel.dev')
},

// AFTER
{
  test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
  include: ['./src', './node_modules/@appearhere/bloom'],
  loader: 'babel',
  query: require('./babel.dev')
}
```

## Running the style guide

To build the style guide for deployment:

```shell
yarn run build
```

This will create a static version of the style guide in `/build`.

To build the style guide for development:

```shell
yarn start
```

This will run the style guide, automatically opening your browser window at the root page. We use hot module reloading, so the vast majority of changes you'll make to components or the style guide itself will auto update on the page.

**NOTE: changes to variables current require you to restart the project, as they're consumed on the initial run üåö**

## React Storybook

Aside from running the style guide locally on your machine, we also have the option to use [React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/).

> React Storybook is a UI development environment for your React components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

To use storybook, simply run:


```shell
yarn run storybook
```

## Building components

All components inside Bloom should:

1. Be reuseable
2. Have tests
3. Have stories (as per React Storybook)

Component styles, tests and stories should live along side their components. Tests and stories are automatically picked up by their respective modules via a strict naming convention:

```
// Component
Link.js

// Styles
Link.css

// Tests
Link.test.js

// Story
Link.story.js
```

Typically speaking, components should live in their own directory with the same name as the component, e.g., `components/Link/Link.js`. In some cases, you may find it makes more sense to have multiple components live in the same directory, where there is a tight relationship between them.

When developing components, it's suggested your start by developing them in isolation, using React Storybook, before adding them to the style guide to demonstrate how they work together with other components. That's not to say you _have_ to do this, how you actually go about it is down to your personal preference.

### Testing components

Currently, we're setup to use [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing.

At minimum, **all** components should have a "does it render" test:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Link from './Link';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<Link />, div);
});

```

You may also want to test class level functions:

```javascript
it('tracks the number of clicks', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  const instance = ReactDOM.render(<Link />, div);

  t.equals(instace.state.clicks, 0);
  instance.trackClick();
  t.equals(instace.state.clicks, 1);
});
```

Be careful when adding tests; we want to ensure that a simple change to a component's mark up, e.g., changing the `className` value, don't result a ton of failing tests. We also need to be wary of when we're effectively testing the React internals as opposed to our own components.

### Developing Bloom alongside your main project

Sometimes you might need to make changes to Bloom while you're working on your main project. Having to flip over to Bloom, PR the changes and get them published is slow and cumbersome. `yarn install ../path/to/bloom` is one option, but every time you make a change, you'll have to redo the command _and_ recompile.

**Enter `yarn link`**

`yarn link` uses symlinks to reference your local copy of Bloom in your main project, meaning changes are reflected in **every** project that consumes your local copy of Bloom.

To get started, head to your copy of Bloom and run

```shell
yarn link
```

This will create a global symlink to your copy of Bloom. Head to your project and run to use this reference instead of the regularly installed package:

```shell
yarn link @appearhere/bloom
```

One flaw with this, is that a Webpack loader's `include` property **won't** follow symlinks. Earlier in the README, we managed to get Bloom into your project like so:

```javascript
{
  test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
  include: ['./src', './node_modules/@appearhere/bloom'],
  loader: 'babel',
  query: require('./babel.dev')
}
```

To make this work, we instead need to ensure the include path to Bloom is absolute:

```javascript
const pathToBloom = fs.realpathSync('./node_modules/@appearhere/bloom');

{
  test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
  include: ['./src', pathToBloom],
  loader: 'babel',
  query: require('./babel.dev')
}
```

Additional bonus: if the loader you're using is setup to work with hot module reloading, changes to Bloom **will also get hot reloaded in your main project** üòç

## Publishing Bloom

### Pre `v1.0.0` / open sourcing

Bloom, as required by NPM, follows [Semvar](http://semver.org/). That said, given it has yet to reach a MVP state, only minor and patch versions will be incremented. This is because the whole project should be treated as **unstable**, i.e., we might change any component at a moments notice. Given that it will only be used internally for now, that's fine.

In this time, a Bloom release will be made, at most, once a day. When publishing Bloom to NPM, increment the minor or patch versions, publish then bump the version of Bloom used in our other projects. This should ensure we're always using the latest and greatest in our applications, and ensure that they never get too far out of sync.

When the frequency of work on Bloom decreases to significantly enough, then consider releasing a `v1.0.0`. This should be when we're making very few changes to components already in the library and we're only adding new ones.

### Post `v1.0.0` / open sourcing

Once we've released `v1.0.0` or open sourced the project, we'll adopt true Semvar. Ideally, we'll make releases based on a roadmap of some form, probably dictated by our internal sprints.

So as to not slow us down, we should continue to publish Bloom on a regular basis, but instead us [pre-releases](https://medium.com/@mbostock/prereleases-and-npm-e778fc5e2420#.6vr4xc28c), e.g., `v1.0.0-0.0.1`. The current thought is that the pre-release versions will follow a similar pattern to Semvar itself, i.e., major.minor.patch.

### Making a release

**Unfortunately, `yarn`'s publishing mechanism doesn't work quite as we'd like, so for now we use `npm`:**

Pull down latest master. Then on master,

1. `npm version [major|minor|patch]` (see below for which one to use)
2. npm will automatically check to make sure the build succeeds and all tests pass
3. `git push [REMOTE] master && git push [REMOTE] master --tags`
4. `npm publish`

When to use what:

- `major`: A change where a consumer of this library will have to change their code to work with this new version
- `minor`: Adding a new feature, or making a major internal change without outward-facing consequences
- `patch`: Fixing a small bug, typo, or other small change

Do not create tags as part of pull requests. Adding new features to master is different to publishing a version to yarn.

More info will be added here when we need to tackle the `v1.0.0` release.

#### Adding a change log

Once you‚Äôve pushed the new version to GitHub and published the release, head to [Bloom's releases](https://github.com/appearhere/bloom/releases/) and add a change log.

You can auto generate one by running:

```bash
git --no-pager log [PREVIOUS_VERSION_TAG]..[NEW_VERSION_TAG] --pretty=format:'- %s %H ' --reverse --no-merges
```

### Post release

As part of the release process, Bloom will automatically be published to [GitHub pages](https://appearhere.github.io/bloom/). This happens via yarn's `postpublish` script, and **requires** the publisher to have the Appear Here remote set up as `origin`, as per [storybook-deployer#8](https://github.com/kadirahq/storybook-deployer/issues/8).

This is a stop gap solution until we have time to set up auto deploying via GitHub or similar.

## Why "Bloom"?

It's the collective name for Jellyfish; they're pretty dumb, [look cool](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/55a7ee522acae7c23f8b4cf6/youtubers-caught-a-jellyfish-sting-in-slow-motion--and-what-they-saw-gave-a-scientist-goosebumps.jpg)
and have a [form of immortality through regeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii#Biological_immortality) which are all aspects of a good pattern library. `bloom.appearhere.co.uk` also sounds decent!

## More information

The repo was bootstrapped with create-react-app, and you can find the readme that it ships with [here](Bootstrap.README.md). It's worth reading if you want to know more about the foundation of this project. Note that some of it might be out of date.
